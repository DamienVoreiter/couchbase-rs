# Couchbase Rust SDK

This is the repository for the official, community supported Couchbase Rust SDK. It is currently a work in progress and built on top of [libcouchbase](https://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase/).

## Start Using

Currently, version `0.3` can be found on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/couchbase) which is going to change a lot in the coming versions. Right now we are working on `1.0.0-alpha.1`, which provides a completely revamed API alongside our "SDK 3" efforts which also affects other language SDKs.

We haven't shipped the alpha yet, so you can depend on the repository directly for now. As soon as artifacts are available, we'll provide usage instructions here.

For now, the [examples](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-rs/tree/master/couchbase/examples) section is the best place to get started until we provide more documentation.

Stay tuned!
